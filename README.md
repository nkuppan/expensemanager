## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-account management** — create and organise transactions across Checking, Savings, Cash, Credit Card, and custom accounts
- **Budget tracking** — set monthly budgets with flexible customisation options and track spending against your targets
- **Transaction management** — log income, expenses, and transfers between accounts with category tagging, notes, and timestamps
- **CSV export** — export your transaction data for use in spreadsheets or other tools (PDF export coming soon)
- **Multi-currency support** — switch display currencies in the UI (full conversion support is planned)

### Analytics & Insights
- **Trend analysis** — visualise your spending patterns across daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes
- **Category breakdown** — interactive pie chart showing where your money goes, grouped by category
- **Income vs. Expense summaries** — at-a-glance totals with colour-coded indicators

### Redesigned Transaction List Screen
The transaction list has been rebuilt from the ground up with a focus on usability and polish:

- **Income / Expense summary cards** — gradient-backed cards at the top showing period totals with glowing accent indicators
- **Account filter pills** — horizontally scrollable chips for quick filtering by account
- **Type filter tabs** — segmented control (All / Expense / Income) with animated selection and count badges
- **Collapsible search** — tap-to-reveal search bar with clear button for fast transaction lookup
- **Date-grouped layout** — transactions grouped by date with daily net totals in each header
- **Swipe-to-reveal actions** — gesture-driven Edit and Delete actions on each row (spring-animated, no external library)
- **Staggered entrance animations** — header, cards, and groups animate in sequentially on load
- **Empty state** — friendly messaging when filters return no results
- **Floating Action Button** — quick-access button for adding new transactions

### Improved Transaction Item Component
Each transaction row has been refined for better visual hierarchy and interaction:

- **Rounded icon container** — 44dp badge with category-tinted background and subtle border
- **Colour-coded amount prefix** — `+` for income (green), `−` for expenses (red) for instant scanning
- **Transfer arrow indicator** — clear `↓` flow between From → To accounts on transfer transactions
- **Notes preview** — single-line muted note text beneath the subtitle
- **Swipe actions** — integrated Edit / Delete reveal with spring physics animation
- **Smooth content transitions** — `animateContentSize()` for expanding/collapsing notes
- **Backward-compatible API** — all new callbacks (`onEdit`, `onDelete`, `onClick`) default to `null`, so existing call sites remain unchanged

### Theming
- Full **Material 3** design system with dynamic color support
- Complete **Dark Theme** implementation
